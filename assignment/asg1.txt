ASG # 1
Write an R script to

files for 1-3 are in DATA directory

1. read  family63A_tab.txt (tab delimited data) 
2. read family63B_FreeForm.txt (free form text file
3. read family63C.csv  (comma delimited)


4. merge/append A, B, C as appropriate

5. Calculate descriptive statistics or frequencies
	a) whole sample
	b) by region


6. Compare average E across regions

7. create  regional dummies  (south=1 if region=3, zero otherwise)
			      (northcentral=1 if region=2, zero otherwise)
			      (west=1 if region=4, zero otherwise)

8. estimate E=f(edu) and 
	E=f(edu, south, northcentral, west)

9. Produce a graph that shows regional differences like the one in varsbyregion_R.pdf
